# Docker Compose Best Practices & Recommendations

This document provides improvement recommendations for your `compose.yaml` file, focusing on security, maintainability, and clarity.

---

## 1. Remove Unnecessary Host Mounts for Read-Only Services
For services like `prometheus-cicd` and `grafana-cicd`, avoid mounting the entire project directory (e.g., `./:/hostdata`, `/MyCode`, `/MyConfig`) unless absolutely necessary. Limit mounts to only what's required for configuration and data persistence. This reduces risk and improves performance.

**Example:**
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./prometheus:/etc/prometheus
  - prom_data:/prometheus
```

---

## 2. Use `.env` File for Secrets and Configs
Move sensitive data (like passwords) and environment variables to a `.env` file. Reference them in your compose file using `${VAR_NAME}`.

**Example in `docker-compose.yaml`:**
```yaml
environment:
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER}
  - GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=${GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD}
```

**Example `.env` file:**
```
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER=admin
GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASSWORD=grafana
```

---

## 3. Use Consistent Indentation
YAML is indentation-sensitive. Ensure all services and keys are aligned at the same level for readability and to avoid parsing errors.

---

## 4. Remove Unused or Redundant Volumes
If a service doesn't need access to a directory, don't mount it. For example, if `grafana-cicd` only needs its datasource config, use only:
```yaml
volumes:
  - ./grafana:/etc/grafana/provisioning/datasources
```

---

## 5. Use Named Networks for Clarity
You already use `custom-network`, which is good. Consider adding `external: false` for clarity if it's not an external network.

---

## 6. Add Healthchecks
Add `healthcheck` sections to critical services like Jenkins, Splunk, Prometheus, and Grafana to help Docker Compose manage service health.

**Example:**
```yaml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:3000"]
  interval: 30s
  timeout: 10s
  retries: 5
```

---

## 7. Use Service Dependencies
Use `depends_on` to ensure services start in the correct order.

**Example:**
```yaml
depends_on:
  - prometheus-cicd
```

---

## 8. Document Each Service
Add a short comment above each service explaining its purpose, especially for custom or less obvious containers.

---

## Summary of Actionable Changes
- Limit volume mounts to only what's needed.
- Move secrets to a `.env` file.
- Add healthchecks and `depends_on`.
- Clean up indentation and comments for clarity.
