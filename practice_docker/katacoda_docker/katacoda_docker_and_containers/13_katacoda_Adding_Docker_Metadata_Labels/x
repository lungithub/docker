What will get it done? Starvation?
Personally speaking I'd say that "the biggest problem I see is food"

 it's extremely difficult for people to lose weight once they've gained it by simply exercising more.

"So the people who lost the most weight on the show weren't necessarily the people who did the most exercise â€” instead, it was the people who ate the least," 

That's why Hall thinks researchers find again and again that exercise can help maintain weight loss, but it doesn't help people lose weight. 

"our bodies may actively fight our efforts to lose weight" ---whaaaat!?
